# Books-Recommender-webapp
IN THIS REPO I HAVE CREATED A WEB APP TO PRDICT TOP 50 BOOKS  BASED ON POPULARITY BASED RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM ALONG ALSO ADDED A SECTION TO RECOMMEND BOOKS WHICH WILL RECOMMENDED 4 BOOKS SIMILAR TO USER INPUT WHICH IS BASED ON COLLABORATIVE FILTERING BASED RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM ,
FOR DOINF THIS 3 DATSETS ARE USED FROM KAGGLE WHICH CONTAIN MAINLY BOOK TILE USER ID AND RATINGS ,FOR MORE ACCURACY  I HAEV PUT FEW RESTRICTIONS LIKE TAKE ONLY THOSE BOOKS WHICH HAVE ALTEAST 200 RATINGS AND ONLY THOSE USERS WHO HAVE MADE MORE THAN 250 REVIEWS OTHERWISE IT MAY BE POSSIBLE A NEW BOOK HAVE VERY HIGH RATING ,& 

WE HAVE USED COSINE SIMILARITY FOR CALCULATING SIMILARITY SCORE AMONG 706 BOOKS AFTER TREATING 706 BOOKS AND USER NO OF RATINGS AS VECTORS, THAT IS EACH ROW OF PIVOT TABLE IS A VECTOR .
AFTER ALL THIS WE HAVE CREATED A FUNC TO RECOMMEND BOOK BASED ON 
DISTANCE BEWTEEN THE FILTERED BOOKS IN 706*810 DIMENSION SYSTEM BOOKS WHICH ARE NEAREST ARE SIMILAR TO THE BOOK WE WANT RECOMMENDATION ON.
